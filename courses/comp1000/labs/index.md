## MyITLab

### Notice:

1. MyITLab quizzes are due on every Friday.  Late quizzes are counted
off by 10%.

2. MyITLab quizzes are all available to take until the last day of
school.

3. To take quizzes at home you have to have a Windows machine (XP,
Vista or Win 7) and Internet Explorer.

Please check your Blackboard course for more information re-guarding
MyItLab.

There is no need to run the myITlab installation wizard anywhere on
campus.  Doing so will damage the computer and myITlab will no longer
work.  If a computer does not work then please contact that labs
administrator (this should be displayed somewhere in the room.)

Including the library there are also a number of other labs on campus
that support myITlab.  Any/all of the other labs may or may not work
with myITlab, they are not supported so do not ask why the computers
do not work in labs not listed.

### Lab Rooms

The following labs are available for finishing all classwork
(including SharePoint class assignments) and taking MyITLab quizzes.

- Lowder: Room 011
- Parker: Room 252, Room 254, Room 256
- Comer: Room 206
- Rouse: Room 105
