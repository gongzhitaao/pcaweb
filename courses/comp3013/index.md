## Course Objectives:

In this course, students will develop the ability to design and implement software applications using technologies that include programmable spreadsheets and databases. Students will be able to develop software tools that interface with production systems and embed analytical models into these systems.

## Course Content:

<i>Two course pre-tests will be administered at the beginning of the semester covering the previous Excel and Programming knowledge required for this course. Class Assignments will be made available once all students will take these pre-tests.</i>

The course consists of several topics spread across the semester including three proctored examinations. There are 8 lab assignments, 5 home assignments and 4 MyITLab modules for training. Learners are required to study from the lecture notes, and do the assigned reading, training sessions and home and lab assignments.  More information is given about these activities in the ‘Course Requirements’ section of the syllabus and also in the course website on Canvas.

All examinations will be proctored. The proctors for the examinations should be recognized by the Distance Learning & Outreach Technology (DLOT) office of Auburn University. More information about the proctors is given in the ‘Examination Process’ section of the syllabus.

A variety of media will be used to communicate among class members and with the instructor. Most of these media will be part of the software Auburn University supports for distance course delivery, that is, Canvas software.  Canvas includes many types of communication tools, including online submission of assignments, email among class members, online discussions, and chats. The students will use some or all of these to complete class requirements.

Lecture and content materials will be provided in Canvas in the form of PowerPoint handouts with voiceover.

## Course Requirements:

*	__Training:__
	>The 4 course training modules are available at Prentice Hall MyITLab website MyITLab (<http://www.myitlab.com/>). The students receive the access code when they purchase a custom package of the text book from the Auburn University book store.

*	__Case Study:__
	>Students will be organized in groups and assigned case study, which is worth 150 points, on "Creating a management application" using all the accumulated knowledge and skills.
	
*	__Assignments:__
	>Lab Assignments are worth 10, 20 points. Students will train themselves using the required MyITLab training and do their homework and lab assignments.  Lab Assignments will be the focus of the weekly class labs whereas students will need to work mostly on their own for the home assignments.  Pop-up quizzes will be administered at lab time from the lab and home assignments content.
	
*	__Examination 1:__
	>Examination 1 is designed to give an opportunity to review all that the students have learned until this point in time. It includes 50 multiple-choice questions for 50 minutes. Reviewing all lectures notes and examples, and working diligently on lab assignments and MyITLab modules will be helpful.  This exam will be available on Canvas.
	
*	__Examination 2:__
	>Examination 2 is designed to give an opportunity to review all that the students have learned until this point in time. It includes hands on exercises for 50 minutes. Reviewing all lectures notes and examples, and working diligently on lab assignments and MyITLab modules will be helpful.  This exam will be available on Canvas.
	
*	__Final Examination:__
	>This final examination will cover all of the material for this course. The examination is designed to give an opportunity to review all that the students have learned from the beginning to this point in time. It is comprehensive and it includes multiple-choice questions as well as hands-on exercises for 2 ½ hours. Reviewing all lectures notes and examples, and working diligently on lab assignments and MyITLab modules will be helpful.  This exam will be available on Canvas.
	
*	__Performance Evaluation:__
	>The students work in this course will be evaluated on the basis of the assignments and Examinations. Examinations will include material from the assigned readings in the text, the assigned exercises, and class lectures. You should expect to do well on the exams only if you read study and understand the assigned readings in the text and complete the assigned exercises.  Detailed information about examinations can be found on the Exams Info web page in the course website. The MyITLab skill modules will be made available online at all times. The final course average will be computed as follows:
