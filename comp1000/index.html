<h2>Personal Computer Applications Syllabus</h2>

<h3>Course Overview</h3>

<p>This course is designed to provide the students with the knowledge,
skills and experience required to utilize personal computers and
Internet effectively.  It is for future end-users of computers who
will use computer technology to solve problems and to make decisions.
Whereas the processing power and storage capacity of personal
computers (PCs) have increased tremendously since their introduction
in the mid-70s the PCs price has consistently decreased make them
accessible to large and small companies or organizations as well as
individual users.  Currently, PCs are being used at all levels in
progressive organizations, ranging from clerical workers to top-level
executives.  In addition, the use of computers is not restricted to
any particular field; their use is beneficial to any area where
decisions need to be made and problems need to be solved.  There are
international efforts made toward eliminating the so-called global
digital divide, which is a term used to describe the great
discrepancies in opportunity to access the Internet between developed
and developing countries or even between different regions of
developed countries.  Four decades since the inception of the Internet
and three decades since the inception of the World Wide Web, while the
global digital divide is still a reality, slowly but surely the
Internet and World Wide Web are becoming part of our daily life.
Hence, it is crucial that learners gain knowledge of and experience
with computer technology as it becomes an integral part of the work
place and daily life.</p>

<h3>Course Requirements</h3>

<h4>1. Mandatory Training</h4>

<p>The training is available at Prentice Hall MyITLab website. You are
strongly advised to work on these training sessions in order to
receive your grade. The website address is
<a href="http://www.pearsoncustom.com/al/au_mitl/">http://www.pearsoncustom.com/al/au_mitl/</a>.
A student access code is necessary to register for MyITLab online
which will be provided in the textbook package.</p>

<h4>2. Assignments</h4>

<p>There are three types of homework assignments, MyITLab, Hands-on, and
Practice Exercises.  Hands-on, and Practice Exercises are available in
the text book and submitted using Canvas.  Each assignment is worth 5
points.  It is required that students read the assignment and take the
required MyITLab skills based assignments before class.
<strong><u>Unexcused Canvas late work can be turned in by one week.
Thereafter, the assignment will not be accepted and CAN NOT be turned
in for a late penalty deduction.</u></strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>The first few chapters covered on MyITLab will test students using
exams in multiple choice format.  Thereafter, all MyITLab exams will
be in skill-based format.  The skill-based training will include a
pre-test, training, and post-test.  Students will begin by taking
the pre-test.  If a student scores 60% or above on the pre-test, the
student will be allowed to advance to the post-test without taking
the training module.  If a student scores below 60% that student
will be required to take the training module, and will be required
to earn 100% on the training module before advancing to the
post-test.  Therefore, students who receive below 60% on the
pre-test will need to re-take the training module until they have
earned 100%.  Afterwards, the student will be allowed to take the
post-test.  The post-test grade is the final portion of the
skill-based training, and the grade earned on the post-test will be
the grade that is considered in the student's final MyITLab average.</p></li>
<li><p>MyITLab assignments may be submitted after the due date with a 10%
late penalty applied.  Students who wish to submit MyITLab
assignments after the due date may do so until the last day of class
with late penalty.  <strong><u>After the last day of class, MyITLab
assignments will no longer be accepted.</u></strong></p></li>
<li><p>MyITLab is compatible only with Windows PC machines and Internet
Explorer.  MyITLab is compatible with MAC computers following the
proper instructions which can be found on the myITlab tab, but NOT
compatible with FireFox, Safari, Chrome, or Opera.</p></li>
<li><p>All COMP 1000 lab computers have been configured to run MyITLab,
however if a student wishes to install MyITLab on his or her
personal laptop, he or she must install the needed software in class
on the first day of class.  If not, the student will be required to
use the COMP 1000 lab to complete MyITLab assignments.  If a student
wishes to use his or her personal laptop computer, it is the
student's responsibility to ensure that the machine is in working
condition and will allow assignments to be submitted by the due
date.  A students failure to get their personal computer working
properly with myITlab will not be considered a valid reason for
submitting work late.</p></li>
</ul>


<h4>3. Case Study 1 &amp; 2</h4>

<p>There are two case studies available and submitted in course website
on Canvas.  An Integrated Case Study with Microsoft Office 2010 and

points.  More information about the studies is available in the course
website on Canvas.</p>
