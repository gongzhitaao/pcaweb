---

## Personal Computer Applications Syllabus (Offcampus)

## Course Overview

This course is designed to provide the students with the knowledge, skills and experience required to utilize personal computers and Internet effectively. It is for future end-users of computers who will use computer technology to solve problems and to make decisions. Whereas the processing power and storage capacity of personal computers (PCs) have increased tremendously since their introduction in the mid-70s the PCs price has consistently decreased make them accessible to large and small companies or organizations as well as individual users. Currently, PCs are being used at all levels in progressive organizations, ranging from clerical workers to top-level executives. In addition, the use of computers is not restricted to any particular field; their use is beneficial to any area where decisions need to be made and problems need to be solved. There are international efforts made toward eliminating the so-called global digital divide, which is a term used to describe the great discrepancies in opportunity to access the Internet between developed and developing countries or even between different regions of developed countries. Four decades since the inception of the Internet and three decades since the inception of the World Wide Web, while the global digital divide is still a reality, slowly but surely the Internet and World Wide Web are becoming part of our daily life. Hence, it is crucial that learners gain knowledge of and experience with computer technology as it becomes an integral part of the work place and daily life.

## Course Requirements

1.	__Mandatory Training__

The training is available at Prentice Hall MyITLab website. You are strongly advised to work on these training sessions in order to receive your grade. The website address is http://www.pearsoncustom.com/al/au_mitl/. A student access code is necessary to register for MyITLab online which will be provided in the textbook package. 

2.	__Assignments__

There are three types of homework assignments, MyITLab, Hands-on, and Practice Exercises. Hands-on, and Practice Exercises are available in the text book and submitted using Canvas. Each assignment is worth 5 points. It is required that students read the assignment and take the required MyITLab skills based assignments before class. __Unexcused Canvas late work can be turned in by one week. Thereafter, the assignment will not be accepted and CAN NOT be turned in for a late penalty deduction.__

	*	The first few chapters covered on MyITLab will test students using exams in multiple choice format.  Thereafter, all MyITLab exams will be in skill-based format.  The skill-based training will include a pre-test, training, and post-test.  Students will begin by taking the pre-test.  If a student scores 60% or above on the pre-test, the student will be allowed to advance to the post-test without taking the training module.  If a student scores below 60% that student will be required to take the training module, and will be required to earn 100% on the training module before advancing to the post-test.  Therefore, students who receive below 60% on the pre-test will need to re-take the training module until they have earned 100%.  Afterwards, the student will be allowed to take the post-test.  The post-test grade is the final portion of the skill-based training, and the grade earned on the post-test will be the grade that is considered in the student's final MyITLab average.
	*	MyITLab assignments may be submitted after the due date with a 10% late penalty applied.  Students who wish to submit MyITLab assignments after the due date may do so until the last day of class with late penalty.  __After the last day of class, MyITLab assignments will no longer be accepted.__
	*	MyITLab is compatible only with Windows PC machines and Internet Explorer.  MyITLab is compatible with MAC computers following the proper instructions which can be found on the myITlab tab, but NOT compatible with FireFox, Safari, Chrome, or Opera.
	*	All COMP 1000 lab computers have been configured to run MyITLab, however if a student wishes to install MyITLab on his or her personal laptop, he or she must install the needed software in class on the first day of class.  If not, the student will be required to use the COMP 1000 lab to complete MyITLab assignments.  If a student wishes to use his or her personal laptop computer, it is the student's responsibility to ensure that the machine is in working condition and will allow assignments to be submitted by the due date. A students failure to get their personal computer working properly with myITlab will not be considered a valid reason for submitting work late.

3.	__Case Study 1 & 2__

There are two case studies available and submitted in course website on Canvas. An Integrated Case Study with Microsoft Office 2010 and the other is a SharePoint Case Study. Each case study is worth 50 points. More information about the studies is available in the course website on Canvas.

## Performance Evaluation

The students work in this course will be evaluated on the basis of the assignments, MyITLab skill modules and Examinations. Exams will be given as an open computer test composed by multiple choice questions requiring you to have a basic understanding of the software and hardware that you will be using. Exams will include material from the assigned readings in the text, the assigned exercises, and class lectures. You should expect to do well on the exams only if you read, study, understand the assigned reading in the text, and complete the assigned exercises. Detailed information about exams can be found on the Exams web page. The MyITLab skill modules will be made available online at the end of each course topic. You should expect to do well on these modules if you carefully study and understand the associated course topic. The final course average will be computed as follows.

The final course grade will be determined by the final class average using the scale below, with the following constraint: to earn a passing grade in this course, a student must earn a passing grade for the assignment average (assignment includes all Lab assignments and the two Case Studies but NOT the MyITLab assignments). An assignment average below 60% will result in an F in the course.

Students are not allowed to redo quizzes and examinations. Therefore, they should check their work carefully with criteria statements before turning in assignments or examinations.

__Exams are open book, closed computer.__

__60% Rule__

Out of the 300 possible points for 'Textbook Assignments and Case Studies' a minimum of 180 points must be obtained or the student will automatically fail the course without consideration of the other grades. Students that do not complete 60% of their assigned course work will not be able to pass. MyITLab assignments DO NOT count toward the 180/300 points needed to satisfy the 60% rule.

## Grading

__IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR HOMEWORK IS CORRECTLY UPLOADED TO Canvas. If you fail to upload an assignment correctly it is up to each instructor to determine if they will allow you to correct this mistake.__

It is also your responsibility to make sure you have submitted the correct assignment and in the correct format.  After you submit an assignment please check and make sure it appears on Canvas and that the correct file has been submitted for that assignment.   Additionally you have 7 days after your grade is posted to discuss that grade.  After 7 days the grade is no longer up for discussion and will be final.

*	Canvas assignments are due on the date assigned in class.  However if, the student is unable to complete the full assignment in class, he or she will have one week from the date assigned to submit the assignment on Canvas without a late penalty.  For example, if an assignment is assigned on August 10 in class, the student will have until August 17 to submit the assignment on Canvas without penalty.  __After 11:00 p.m. on the date assigned the student will see "Late" next to the assignment, however this is only a reminder that the assignment still needs to be submitted within the one week interval.__  No late penalty will be applied.  __After this one week interval, the assignment will close and the student will not be able to submit his or her work.__

*	Please note that the last week of school is not the time to be asking if you can submit assignments or make up missed assignments. Unless you can provide the required valid University approved excusses you will not be allowed to make up any missed work. The quicker you take action the more of a chance you may have. It is at the discrection of the instructor as to weather or not they will allow you to submit assignments after their due date without a penatly. __Just because you were able to submit one assignment late does not mean that you will be allowed to submit the next.__

### Assignment Makeup

When you miss class and have a valid university excuse you will have a two week grace period to make up late assignments without penalty when you return to class.  After the two week grace period late assignments will not be accepted for points.

*	Students will have 7 days from the date listed on the make-up document to present this document to the instructor and make plans for submitting make-up work.  After this time, the excuse will not be accepted.

### Communication Channels

The ONLY official method of communication between Instructor and students is Tigermail. Any use of Canvas's or myITlab's build in mail system are not considered official lines of communication and anything sent using them will not be considered valid work/communication and is not subject to the rules and conditions set forth in this syllabus. Both mail systems are not actively monitored and messages that are found will be removed without consideration for their content since they are not binding communications between instructor and student.

Any email between Instructor and student using Tigermail will be considered official communication and will be subject to follow all guidelines set forth in this syllabus.

The Announcement section that displays after entering your section of myITlab is also considered an official form of communication and any information that is located there will be considered binding to the syllabus.

### Attendance

Attendance is essential if a student is to understand and assimilate the material in this course. If a student must miss a class, he/she should make arrangements ahead of time to complete the assignment and turn it in on time. Since class time is so limited, assistance or lecture information for completing an assignment that was done/due in a previous class will not be provided during a subsequent class. Instructors post their slides for each day of class, students are responsible for keeping up with their work. The instructor is not required to send emails or remind students of assignment due dates beyond the inital introduction of the assignment/test itself.

### Make-up Exams

Make-ups will only be given with a valid university excuse. This means a Doctors statement (not an In-Out slip) or other documentation must be provided. All make-ups will be given on one of the two designated Makeup Days. The student is responsible for informing the instructor prior to missing an exam no later than one week after the exam official date. __Please remember that in order to take an exam after missing a make-up day, you will need to present 2 excuses (one for the day of the exam, and one for the make-up day).__

### Friday Help

In order to provide assistance with make-up assignments and in general for helping students in accomplishing as much as possible, we offer Friday Help sessions, on Fridays from 10:00 am to 3:00 pm. One of the COMP1000 instructors will be in COMP1000 lab to help the COMP1000 students. Please make use of this opportunity as it will be a great help to your understanding of the topics covered as well as provide more time for you to ask questions if you need it.
