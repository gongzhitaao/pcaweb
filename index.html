  <h2>Welcome to Auburn University Personal Computer Applications
    Portal!</h2>

  <p>At Auburn University, we believe that inspiring more students to
    choose careers in IT and computing it's a compelling issue of
    innovation, competitiveness, and workforce sustainability.</p>

  <p>In a global economy, attracting more students in IT and computing
    means a larger and more competitive workforce; in a world dependent
    on innovation, it means the ability to design technology that is as
    broad and creative as the people it serves.</p>
