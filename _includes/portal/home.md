#### Welcome to Auburn University Personal Computer Application Portal

At Auburn University, we believe that inspiring more students to
choose careers in IT and computing it's a compelling issue of
innovation, competitiveness, and workforce sustainability.

In a global economy, attracting more students in IT and computing
means a larger and more competitive workforce; in a world dependent on
innovation, it means the ability to design technology that is as broad
and creative as the people it serves.

War Eagle!
