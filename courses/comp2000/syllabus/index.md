### Course Purpose/Objectives

This course provides learners with knowledge, skills, practice and experience in developing Web pages and Web sites using HTML/XHTML, basics object oriented programming techniques, assuming that learners have little or no programming experience,  fundamental skills necessary to becoming a talented and successful Java programmer.  It consists of two conceptually different parts. The first part is about designing and developing Web pages and Web site with HTML/XHTML, CSS, using multimedia on the Web, and creating dynamic Web pages using with JavaScript.  The second part is about object-oriented programming, beginning with the fundamentals of object-oriented programming and moving forward to special skills for using Java programming toward developing a Graphical User Interface (GUI) and Web applications.

You must be registered for this course in order to pass. Lecture and lab sessions attendance is strongly recommended.   All make-up labs and exams require a university approved excuse. Make-up exams will be different from the regular exams, and hence, may be more difficult.

### Special Accommodations

Students needing special accommodations should see Dr. Marghitu as soon as possible.

### Lecture Information

__Dr. Daniela Marghitu__ will have office hours/help sessions that he will announce and will be posted in the COMP2000 BlackBoard account. His primary responsibilities are lecture, midterm exams, and final exam, coordination of the lab activity. The lectures content and schedule will be available via the course COMP2000 BlackBoard account.

### Laboratory Information

For any Lab Assignments and Exams grades related question contact first the COMP2000 Lab instructor, in the lab, via e-mail or phone. The Lab instructor's work hours and contact information will be posted on the COMP2000 BlackBoard account.

The Lab Assignments content and schedule will be available via the COMP2000 BlackBoard account.  The Lab Assignments solutions will be as well submitted via the COMP2000 BlackBoard account. Lab Assignments will be graded based on the following Grading Policy.

### Grading Policy

You are expected to do your own work. Copying someone else's lab, or changing someone else's work and turning it in as your work is considered cheating. It's OK to talk with others about how to do something if you are having a problem, but then you have to do it, not copy it. When you have a problem, the best source of help is your Lab Instructor and Lecturer.

Your name on the lab means it is your work. Turning in someone else's work as your own will mean (first offense) a zero on the assignment. Two or more offenses or cheating on exams will be referred to the University Academic Honesty Committee.

Assignments will be handed out in advance of when they are due, so make sure you understand when an assignment is due. Your work will not be taken late, except for officially excused absences.

### Lab Assignments Grading Guidelines

Lab Assignments will be graded using the following guidelines and scales:

__10% style__ -This means that your HTML text or Java program "looks" good. It should have appropriate comments, indentation, meaningful variable names. In general, the program should incorporate features that make it easy to read and understand.

__10% output style__ - This means that when your HTML text or Java program produces output, the output looks good.

__10% program structure__ - As you will see, there are ways to structure the behavior of a program as well as its appearance. This percentage evaluates how well you structured the program.

__20% follows lab specifications__ - If for example, the lab specifies that you use a particular feature of the HTML  or Java language or a particular approach to solving a problem, you are expected to follow these directions. If you're not sure what you're supposed to do, ask for clarification!

__50% correctness__ - Your grade here will be determined according to a level of correctness. Levels of correctness are -- the HTML text or Java program :

*	works for all test cases (loss of no points).
*	works for some test cases but not all (loss of at least 40% of   points).
*	compiles and runs but gives wrong answers (loss of at least 60 % of  points).
*	compiles, but crashes during execution (loss of at least 80% of points).
*	fails to even compile (loss of all points).
