COMP6000 Semester Project
=========================

The goal of this project is to rewrite Dr. Daniela Marghitu's personal
website,
[Persoal Computer Applications (PCA)](http://pca.eng.auburn.edu/).
The original website seems to be implemented using ASP.NET.  As
requested, I will have to reimplement using pure HTML5, Javascript and
CSS3.  What's more, this site will be more of a static site.  Jekyll
is perfect for this site :)
