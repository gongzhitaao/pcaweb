<h2 id='course_overview'>Course Overview</h2>

<p>This course is designed to provide the students with the knowledge, skills and experience required to utilize personal computers and Internet effectively. It is for future end-users of computers who will use computer technology to solve problems and to make decisions. Whereas the processing power and storage capacity of personal computers (PCs) have increased tremendously since their introduction in the mid-70s the PCs price has consistently decreased make them accessible to large and small companies or organizations as well as individual users. Currently, PCs are being used at all levels in progressive organizations, ranging from clerical workers to top-level executives. In addition, the use of computers is not restricted to any particular field; their use is beneficial to any area where decisions need to be made and problems need to be solved. There are international efforts made toward eliminating the so-called global digital divide, which is a term used to describe the great discrepancies in opportunity to access the Internet between developed and developing countries or even between different regions of developed countries. Four decades since the inception of the Internet and three decades since the inception of the World Wide Web, while the global digital divide is still a reality, slowly but surely the Internet and World Wide Web are becoming part of our daily life. Hence, it is crucial that learners gain knowledge of and experience with computer technology as it becomes an integral part of the work place and daily life.</p>

<h2 id='course_requirements'>Course Requirements</h2>

<p><strong>1. Mandatory Training</strong></p>

<p>The training is available at Prentice Hall MyITLab website. You are strongly advised to work on these training sessions in order to receive your grade. The website address is <a href='helo'>http://www.pearsoncustom.com/al/au_mitl/</a>. Student access code is necessary to register for MyITLab online which will be provided in the textbook package.</p>

<p><strong>2. Assignments</strong></p>

<p>There are three types of homework assignments, MyITLab, Hands-on, and Practice Exercises. Hands-on, and Practice Exercises are available in the text book and submitted using Canvas. Each assignment is worth 5 points. It is required that students read the assignment and take the required MyITLab skills based assignments before class. Unexcused Canvas late work can be turned in by one week. Thereafter, the assignment will not be accepted and CAN NOT be turned in for a late penalty deduction.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The first few chapters covered on MyITLab will test students using exams in multiple choice format. Thereafter, all MyITLab exams will be in skill-based format. The skill-based training will include a pre-test, training, and post-test. Students will begin by taking the pre-test. If a student scores 60% or above on the pre-test, the student will be allowed to advance to the post-test without taking the training module. If a student scores below 60% that student will be required to take the training module, and will be required to earn 100% on the training module before advancing to the post-test. Therefore, students who receive below 60% on the pre-test will need to re-take the training module until they have earned 100%. Afterwards, the student will be allowed to take the post-test. The post-test grade is the final portion of the skill-based training, and the grade earned on the post-test will be the grade that is considered in the student&#8217;s final MyITLab average.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>MyITLab assignments may be submitted after the due date with a 10% late penalty applied. Students who wish to submit MyITLab assignments after the due date may do so until the last day of class with late penalty. After the last day of class, MyITLab assignments will no longer be accepted.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>MyITLab is compatible only with Windows PC machines and Internet Explorer. MyITLab is compatible with MAC computers following the proper instructions which can be found on the myITlab tab, but NOT compatible with FireFox, Safari, Chrome, or Opera.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>All COMP 1000 lab computers have been configured to run MyITLab, however if a student wishes to install MyITLab on his or her personal laptop, he or she must install the needed software in class on the first day of class. If not, the student will be required to use the COMP 1000 lab to complete MyITLab assignments. If a student wishes to use his or her personal laptop computer, it is the student&#8217;s responsibility to ensure that the machine is in working condition and will allow assignments to be submitted by the due date. A students failure to get their personal computer working properly with myITlab will not be considered a valid reason for submitting work late.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3. Case Study 1 &amp; 2</strong></p>

<p>There are two case studies available and submitted in course website on Canvas. An Integrated Case Study with Microsoft Office 2010 and the other is a SharePoint Case Study. Each case study is worth 50 points. More information about the studies is available in the course website on Canvas.</p>

<p><strong>4. Examination 1</strong></p>

<p>There will be a proctored Examination 1 available on myITlab. The examination will cover the material from topics 1 - 4. This is designed to give an opportunity to review all that the students have learned until this point in time, and is skill-based. Completing your myITlab assignments will greatly help you in the exam.</p>

<p><strong>5. Examination 2</strong></p>

<p>There will be a proctored Examination 2 available on myITlab. The examination will cover the material from topics 5 - 6. This is designed to give an opportunity to review all that the students have learned until this point in time, and is skill-based.

<h2 id='performance_evaluation'>Performance Evaluation</h2>

<p>The students work in this course will be evaluated on the basis of the assignments, MyITLab skill modules and Examinations. Exams will be given as an open computer test composed by multiple choice questions requiring you to have a basic understanding of the software and hardware that you will be using. Exams will include material from the assigned readings in the text, the assigned exercises, and class lectures. You should expect to do well on the exams only if you read, study, understand the assigned reading in the text, and complete the assigned exercises. Detailed information about exams can be found on the Exams web page. The MyITLab skill modules will be made available online at the end of each course topic. You should expect to do well on these modules if you carefully study and understand the associated course topic. The final course average will be computed as follows.</p>
