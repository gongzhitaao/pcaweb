<h2 id='course_objectives'>Course Objectives:</h2>

<p>In this course, students will develop the ability to design and implement software applications using technologies that include programmable spreadsheets and databases. Students will be able to develop software tools that interface with production systems and embed analytical models into these systems.</p>

<h2 id='course_content'>Course Content:</h2>
<i>Two course pre-tests will be administered at the beginning of the semester covering the previous Excel and Programming knowledge required for this course. Class Assignments will be made available once all students will take these pre-tests.</i>
<p>The course consists of several topics spread across the semester including three proctored examinations. There are 8 lab assignments, 5 home assignments and 4 MyITLab modules for training. Learners are required to study from the lecture notes, and do the assigned reading, training sessions and home and lab assignments. More information is given about these activities in the ‘Course Requirements’ section of the syllabus and also in the course website on Canvas.</p>

<p>All examinations will be proctored. The proctors for the examinations should be recognized by the Distance Learning &amp; Outreach Technology (DLOT) office of Auburn University. More information about the proctors is given in the ‘Examination Process’ section of the syllabus.</p>

<p>A variety of media will be used to communicate among class members and with the instructor. Most of these media will be part of the software Auburn University supports for distance course delivery, that is, Canvas software. Canvas includes many types of communication tools, including online submission of assignments, email among class members, online discussions, and chats. The students will use some or all of these to complete class requirements.</p>

<p>Lecture and content materials will be provided in Canvas in the form of PowerPoint handouts with voiceover.</p>
