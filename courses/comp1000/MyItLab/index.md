# MyItLab

---

## Notice:

	1. MyItLab quizzes are due on every Friday.  Late quizzes are counted off by 10%.
	2. MyITLab quizzes are all available to take until the last day of school.
	3. To take quizzes at home you have to have a Windows machine (XP, Vista or Win 7) and Internet Explorer.

Please check your Blackboard course for more information re-guarding MyItLab.

**There is no need to run the myITlab installation wizard anywhere on campus. Doing so will damage the computer and myITlab will no longer work. If a computer does not work then please contact that labs administrator (this should be displayed somewhere in the room.)**

Including the library there are also a number of other labs on campus that support myITlab (<http://pca.eng.auburn.edu/index.aspx/CMS/comp1000/POST/106/>). Any/all of the other labs may or may not work with myITlab, they are not supported so do not ask why the computers do not work in labs not listed.
