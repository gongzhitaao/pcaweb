14.	 Application Development with Excel and VBA

### Course Objectives:

In this course, students will develop the ability to design and implement software applications using technologies that include programmable spreadsheets and databases. Students will be able to develop software tools that interface with production systems and embed analytical models into these systems.

### Course Content:

<i>A course pre-test will be administered at the beginning of the semester covering the previous Excel and Programming knowledge required for this course. Class Assignments will be made available once all students will take this pre-test.</i>

The course consists of several topics spread across the semester including three proctored examinations. There are 8 lab assignments, 5 home assignments and 4 MyITLab modules for training. Learners are required to study from the lecture notes, and do the assigned reading, training sessions and home and lab assignments.

### Course Requirements:

#### Training:

The 4 course training modules are available at Prentice Hall MyITLab website MyITLab (<http://myitlab.com/>). The students receive the access code when they purchase a custom package of the text book from the Auburn University book store.

#### Case Study:

Students will be organized in groups and assigned case study, which is worth 150 points, on "Creating a management application" using all the accumulated knowledge and skills.

#### Assignments:

Lab Assignments are worth 10, 20 points. Students will train themselves using the required MyITLab training and do their homework and lab assignments. Lab Assignments will be the focus of the weekly class labs whereas students will need to work mostly on their own for the home assignments. Pop-up quizzes will be administered at lab time from the lab and home assignments content.

#### Examination 1:

Examination 1 is designed to give an opportunity to review all that the students have learned until this point in time. It includes 50 multiple-choice questions for 50 minutes. Reviewing all lectures notes and examples, and working diligently on lab assignments and MyITLab modules will be helpful.

#### Examination 2:

Examination 2 is designed to give an opportunity to review all that the students have learned until this point in time. It includes hands on exercises for 50 minutes. Reviewing all lectures notes and examples, and working diligently on lab assignments and MyITLab modules will be helpful.

#### Final Examination:

This final examination will cover all of the material for this course. The examination is designed to give an opportunity to review all that the students have learned from the beginning to this point in time. It is comprehensive and it includes multiple-choice questions as well as hands-on exercises for 2 ½ hours. Reviewing all lectures notes and examples, and working diligently on lab assignments and MyITLab modules will be helpful.

#### Performance Evaluation:

The students work in this course will be evaluated on the basis of the assignments and Examinations. Examinations will include material from the assigned readings in the text, the assigned exercises, and class lectures. You should expect to do well on the exams only if you read study and understand the assigned readings in the text and complete the assigned exercises.  Detailed information about examinations can be found on the Exams Info web page in the course website. The MyITLab skill modules will be made available online at all times. The final course average will be computed as follows:

<table border="1" align="center" summary="Class points table">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Home &amp; Lab Assignments + Case Study</td>
<td>35%</td>
<td>350pts</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Exam 1</td>
<td>10%</td>
<td>100 pts</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Exam 2</td>

<tr>
<td>Final Exam</td>
<td>35%</td>
<td>350 pts</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Total</td>
<td>100%</td>
<td>1000 pts</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

The final course grade will be determined by the final class average using the scale below, with the following constraint: to earn a passing grade in this course, a student must earn a passing grade for the assignment average. An assignment average below 60% will result in an F in the course.

<table border="1" align="center">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>90% or above</td>
<td>A</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>80%-89%</td>
<td>B</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>70%-79%</td>
<td>C</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>60%-69%</td>
<td>D</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Less than 60%</td>
<td>F</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Students are allowed to redo examinations only upon presenting.  Therefore, they should check their work carefully with criteria statements before turning in assignments or examinations. The students will be required to complete the online Course Evaluation Questionnaire before the final course grade is officially recorded.

### Prerequisite & Computer Access Necessary:

A computer with Windows 7, Windows XP or Vista operating system, Microsoft Office 20010 and an internet connection is necessary. Basic Excel and Object Oriented Programming skills are necessary.

### Late Submissions:

Assignments late submission will only be allowed with a valid university excuse. This means a Doctor's statement (not an In-Out slip) or other documentation must be provided. An assignment has to be submitted no later than one week after the date covered by the valid university excuse and no later than the last day of class.

### Make-up Examinations:

Make-up exams will only be given with a valid university excuse. This means a Doctor's statement (not an In-Out slip) or other documentation must be provided. All make-ups will be given at the end of the semester unless other arrangements are made with the instructor. The student is responsible for informing the instructor prior to missing an examination or no later than one week after the examination or skill assessment test official date.
